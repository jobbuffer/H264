An Overview of Image Compression Approaches

In transmission applications, such as broadcast television, remote sensing via satellite, aircraft, radar,  sonar,  teleconferencing,computer communications,  facsimile  transmission,  and multimedia systems, compression techniques are constrained by real time and on-line considerations that limit the size and complexity of the hardware.
There are three main reasons why present multimedia systems require that data must be compressed: 1) large storage requirements of multimedia data, 2) relatively slow storage devices that do not allow playing multimedia data (especially video) in real-time, and 3) the present network bandwidth, which does not allow real-time video data transmission.
